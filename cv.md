After moving to the UK in August 2019, I joined 10x - a Bank-as-a-Service company with numerous tier 1 banks as clients. 
As an SRE, I maintained operational excellence for our clients utilizing the latest technologies in Kubernetes and cloud-native architecture. 
Technologies included Prometheus/Grafana, Splunk, Helm, Terraform, and Concourse CI. 
Job required handling both "Proactive" and "Reactive" workloads, involving fixing severity 1/2 incidents efficiently. Also required on-call shifts using alertmanager and PagerDuty.

The team's objective was to make developers' jobs as smooth as possible, which included maintaining the 3 major build pipelines for iOS, Android, and Windows Desktop and automating lesser tasks for git or Jira. 
After 4 months, I took responsibility for automating the provisioning of our build server farm and also worked on automating deployments of new build machines, using Golang to create an exporter of Jenkins data into Prometheus.

### KMD
**Cloud Platform Engineer**

**Description:**
This was my first job. Originally hired as a trainee Java developer, I moved to the platform team after a year. 
In the platform team, I was one of two engineers maintaining the “PaaS Engine,” which functioned like an internal cloud provider, providing EC2/Compute instances to internal projects using Python and Saltstack for automation and provisioning servers from our bare-metal datacenter. 
Most of my knowledge was gained from this project, and I was taken off the project when it was bought by IBM Cloud.
