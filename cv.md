## Experience

### Expedia Group
**Senior Platform Engineer | Contract**  
October 2022 - Present | London, UK

**Description:**
My first contract role, I help manage Expedia's massive cloud infrastructure footprint with a 3-digit number of Kubernetes clusters. It's no easy task to maintain operation and maintainability. I'm part of the team responsible for the operation of the clusters, a team comprised of 3 locations across the world.

### GoHenry
**Senior Platform Engineer**  
March 2021 - October 2022 | London, UK

**Description:**
I joined GoHenry to continue my career in fintech. As a senior engineer, I took on more responsibility and shared complete responsibility for the cloud infrastructure with the lead engineer in the platform team. My main responsibility was around Kubernetes, ensuring the most reliable operation for hosting 800 microservices across 4 clusters. I led the migration to the Istio service mesh from NGINX-ingress with zero downtime. We originally had 8 clusters, 2 for each project with a cluster in the US and a cluster in the UK, which were merged together during the migration to Istio with zero downtime.

### 10x
**Site Reliability Engineer**  
September 2019 - March 2021 | London, UK

**Description:**
After moving to the UK, I joined 10x, a Bank-as-a-Service company with numerous tier 1 banks as clients. As an SRE, I worked on maintaining operational excellence for our clients using the latest technologies in Kubernetes and cloud-native architecture. Key technologies included Prometheus/Grafana, Splunk, Helm, Terraform, and Concourse CI. The job required flexibility, often switching between proactive and reactive workloads. Reactive tasks involved fixing severity 1/2 incidents efficiently and quickly, and the job required on-call shifts using Alertmanager and PagerDuty.

### Widex
**Software Delivery Engineer**  
October 2018 - April 2019 | Lynge, Denmark

**Description:**
After completing my education, I joined Widex in the SWISS team (Software & Infrastructure Services), aiming to smooth developers' jobs. This meant maintaining pipelines for iOS, Android, and Windows-Desktop, and automating tasks for Git or Jira. Within four months, I was responsible for automating the provisioning of our build server farm and worked on automating deployments of new build machines using Golang to create an exporter of Jenkins data into Prometheus.

### KMD
**Cloud Platform Engineer**  
December 2015 - September 2018 | Ballerup, Denmark

**Description:**
This was my first job; initially hired as a trainee Java developer, I moved to the platform team after a year. In the platform team, I was one of two engineers maintaining the "PaaS Engine," which functioned as an internal cloud provider, offering EC2/Compute instances to internal projects. The project heavily used Python and Saltstack to automate and provision servers from our bare-metal data center. I learned most of what I know from this project and was taken off the project when it was acquired by IBM Cloud.
