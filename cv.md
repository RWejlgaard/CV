### Widex - Software Delivery  Engineer
Oct 2018 - April 2019 | Lynge, Denmark
#### Description
After finishing my education I was approached by a recruiter from Widex.

I was hired in October of 2018, into the SWISS team - which is short for Software & Infrastructure Services. 

The teams objective was to make the developers jobs as smooth as possible.

This meant maintaining the 3 major build pipelines for iOS, Android and Windows-Desktop. 

Automate lesser tasks such as miscellaneous tasks for git or Jira. 

After about 4 months of working at Widex, I was given the responsibility to automate the provisioning of our build server farm. 

My last two months at Widex I worked on automating deployments of new build machines

### KMD - Cloud Platform Engineer
Dec 2015 - Sep 2018 | Ballerup, Denmark
#### Description
A year into my bachelor I found myself joining KMD - the largest IT solution provider for the governments of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. 

I was employed full-time while doing my bachelor in the evening. 

Originally I joined the company as a Java developer in the Oracle department - I did not find that position particularly enjoyable. 

After 1 year I moved over to the ”Cloud Team” 

The cloud team managed and maintained all server requirements for internal projects. 

After joining the team I quickly found out I enjoyed the scripting and operation aspects of DevOps.

#### Too Long Didn't Read
* I was hired during my education 
* Worked as a Java Developer in the beginning, didn’t enjoy it 
* Moved to DevOps and stayed until my education finished. 
* Working with Saltstack and Python primarily. 
* Helped getting Kubernetes started in the company
