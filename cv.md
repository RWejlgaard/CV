## Experience

### Expedia Group
**Senior Platform Engineer | Contract**  
October 2022 - Present | London, UK

**Description:**  
My first contract role, I help manage Expedia's massive cloud infrastructure footprint. With a 3-digit number of Kubernetes clusters, it's no easy task to maintain operation and maintainability. I'm part of the team responsible for the operation of the clusters, a team comprised of 3 locations across the world.

### GoHenry
**Senior Platform Engineer**  
March 2021 - October 2022 | London, UK

**Description:**  
I joined GoHenry to continue my career in fintech. Now as a senior engineer, I had taken on more responsibility. I shared complete responsibility of the cloud infrastructure with the lead engineer in the platform team. My main responsibility was around Kubernetes, where I ensured the most reliable operation for hosting 800 microservices across 4 clusters. In my time there, I led the migration onto the Istio service mesh from NGINX-ingress with zero downtime during the entire migration. We originally had 8 clusters, 2 for each project with a cluster in the US and a cluster in the UK, which were merged together during the migration to Istio with zero downtime as well.

### 10x
**Site Reliability Engineer**  
September 2019 - March 2021 | London, UK

**Description:**  
After moving to the UK in August 2019, I joined 10x, a Bank-as-a-Service company with numerous tier 1 banks as clients. As an SRE, I worked on maintaining operational excellence for our clients using the latest technologies in Kubernetes and cloud-native architecture. Key technologies included Prometheus/Grafana, Splunk, Helm, Terraform, and Concourse CI. The job required a flexible mind, often jumping between "Proactive" and "Reactive" workloads. Reactive work involved fixing severity 1/2 incidents efficiently. The role also required on-call shifts, managed using Alertmanager and PagerDuty.

### Widex
**Software Delivery Engineer**  
October 2018 - April 2019 | Lynge, Denmark

**Description:**  
After finishing my education, I was approached by a recruiter from Widex. I joined in October 2018, into the SWISS team (Software & Infrastructure Services). The team's objective was to make the developers' jobs as smooth as possible, maintaining the major build pipelines for iOS, Android, and Windows-Desktop. I automated various tasks for Git or Jira and was given the responsibility to automate the provisioning of our build server farm. My last two months at Widex involved automating deployments of new build machines and using Golang to create an exporter of Jenkins data into Prometheus.

### KMD
**Cloud Platform Engineer**  
December 2015 - September 2018 | Ballerup, Denmark

**Description:**  
This was my first job, originally hired as a trainee Java developer but moved to the platform team after a year. In the platform team, I was one of two engineers maintaining the "PaaS Engine," which worked like an internal cloud provider, providing EC2/Compute instances to internal projects. The project used Python and Saltstack heavily to automate and provision servers from our bare-metal datacenter. I learned most of what I know from this project, which was later bought by IBM Cloud.
