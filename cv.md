## Experience

### Expedia Group
**Senior Platform Engineer | Contract**  
October 2022 - Present | London, UK  

**Description:**
My first contract role, I help manage Expedia's massive cloud infrastructure footprint with a three-digit number of Kubernetes clusters. It's no easy task to maintain operation and maintainability. I'm part of the team that is responsible for the operation of the clusters, collaborating across three locations worldwide.

### GoHenry
**Senior Platform Engineer**  
March 2021 - October 2022 | London, UK  

**Description:**
I joined GoHenry to continue my career in fintech. As a senior engineer, I took on more responsibility, sharing complete responsibility of the cloud infrastructure with the lead engineer in the platform team. My main responsibility was around Kubernetes, ensuring reliable operation for hosting 800 microservices across 4 clusters. I led the migration to the Istio service mesh from NGINX-ingress with zero downtime during the entire migration. This involved merging eight clusters (two for each project) into a streamlined set, maintaining operations in the US and UK without disruption.

### 10x
**Site Reliability Engineer**  
September 2019 - March 2021 | London, UK  

**Description:**
After moving to the UK in August 2019, I joined 10x, a Bank-as-a-Service company with numerous tier 1 banks as clients. As an SRE, I worked on maintaining operational excellence for our clients using the latest technologies in Kubernetes and cloud-native architecture. Key technologies included Prometheus/Grafana, Splunk, Helm, Terraform, and Concourse CI. The role required flexibility, managing both "Proactive" and "Reactive" workloads, with on-call shifts managed by alertmanager and PagerDuty.

### Widex
**Software Delivery Engineer**  
October 2018 - April 2019 | Lynge, Denmark  

**Description:**
After finishing my education, I was approached by a recruiter from Widex. I joined the SWISS team (Software & Infrastructure Services) to help make developers' jobs smoother. Tasks included maintaining the major build pipelines for iOS, Android, and Windows-Desktop, and automating tasks for Git or Jira. I also automated the provisioning of our build server farm and created a Golang exporter of Jenkins data into Prometheus.

### KMD
**Cloud Platform Engineer**  
December 2015 - September 2018 | Ballerup, Denmark  

**Description:**
This was my first job, initially hired as a trainee Java developer. I moved to the platform team after a year, becoming one of two engineers maintaining the "PaaS Engine," an internal cloud provider project. This involved heavy use of Python and Saltstack to automate and provision servers from our bare-metal datacenter. I gained considerable knowledge from this project and was part of the team when the project was acquired by IBM Cloud.
