### GoHenry
**Senior Platform Engineer**  
March 2021 - October 2022 | London, UK  

**Description:**  
I joined GoHenry to continue my career in fintech. Now as a senior engineer I had taken on more responsibility. I shared complete responsibility of the cloud infrastructure with the lead engineer in the platform team. My main responsibility was around Kubernetes, where I ensured the most reliable operation for hosting 800 microservices across 4 clusters. In my time there I had been in the lead of migrating onto the Istio service mesh from NGINX-ingress with zero downtime during the entire migration. We originally had 8 clusters, 2 for each project with a cluster in the US and a cluster in the UK. Which was merged together during the migration to Istio with zero downtime as well.

### 10x
**Site Reliability Engineer**  
September 2019 - March 2021 | London, UK  

**Description:**  
After moving to the UK in August 2019, I joined 10x. 10x is a Bank-as-a-Service company, 10x has numerous tier 1 banks as clients. As an SRE, I worked on maintaining operational excellence for our clients. This was done utilizing the latest technologies in Kubernetes and cloud-native architecture. A few key technologies we used were the likes of Prometheus/Grafana, Splunk, Helm, Terraform, and Concourse CI. The job required a flexible mind and I often jumped back and forth between "Proactive" and "Reactive" workloads. The Reactive side involved fixing various issues such as severity 1/2 incidents, with a focus on efficiency and speed. The job also required on-call shifts which we used alertmanager and PagerDuty for.

This was my first job, I was originally hired as a trainee Java developer but I ended up moving to the platform team after a year.
