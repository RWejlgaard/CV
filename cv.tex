\descript{| Software Delivery Engineer}
\location{Oct 2018 - April 2019 | Lynge, Denmark}

\location{Description:}
After finishing my education I was approached by a recruiter from Widex. \\
I was hired in October of 2018, into the SWISS team - which is short for Software \& Infrastructure Services. \\
The teams objective was to make the developers jobs as smooth as possible. \\
This meant maintaining the 3 major build pipelines for iOS, Android and Windows-Desktop. \\
Automate lesser tasks such as miscellaneous tasks for git or Jira. \\
After about 4 months of working at Widex, I was given the responsibility to automate the provisioning of our build server farm. \\
My last two months at Widex I worked on automating deployments of new build machines

\descript{| Cloud Platform Engineer }
\location{Dec 2015 - Sep 2018 | Ballerup, Denmark}

\location{Description:}
A year into my bachelor I found myself joining KMD - the largest IT solution provider for the governments of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. \\
I was employed full-time while doing my bachelor in the evening. \\
Originally I joined the company as a Java developer in the Oracle department - I did not find that position particularly enjoyable. \\
After 1 year I moved over to the ”Cloud Team” \\
The cloud team managed and maintained all server requirements for internal projects. \\
After joining the team I quickly found out I enjoyed the scripting and operation aspects of DevOps.
