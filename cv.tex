\location{Description:}
After moving to the UK in August 2019, I joined 10x. \\
10x is a Bank-as-a-Service company, 10x has numerous tier 1 banks as clients. \\
As an SRE I'm working on maintaining operational excellence for our clients. \\
This is done utilizing the latest technologies in Kubernetes and cloud native architecture. \\
A few key technologies we use is the likes of Prometheus/Grafana, Splunk, Helm, Terraform and Concourse CI. \\
The job requires a flexible mind and I often jump back and forth between "Proactive" and "Reactive" workloads. \\
The Reactive side is fixing various issues such as severity 1/2 incidents, with a focus on efficiency and speed. \\
The job requires on-call shifts which we use alertmanager and PagerDuty for. \\
